React Native Coding Task for Teknomatics

## Getting started

First install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then, run the project:

```sh
npm start
```

## Task

The task is to implement a simple camera app that allows the user to record a video and save it to the device's gallery.

The app has two screens:

- The first screen prompts user for name and email and saves it to the device's storage.
- The second screen asks for camera permissions and allows the user to record a video. The video is saved later in the device's gallery.
